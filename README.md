# Introduction to CosmosDB Talk - Demo Code
This is demo content associated with my Introduction to CosmosDB. The demo is intended to be run using local emulators with the supplied sample data.

There are a few prerequisites:

- Visual Studio 2017 (any edition)
- You should have the CosmosDB Emulator available to you. You can find out more information at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator 
- A JSON file for sample data is part of the project and titled "CosmosDB_Data_Sample_NutritionData.json". You can use the CosmosDB Migration tool to import this data into your local collection. More details can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/import-data
